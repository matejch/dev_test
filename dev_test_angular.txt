Solve challenges below. If anything is unclear use your own judgment to make a reasonable assumption. Make sure you explain your assumption and reasoning behind it.


1. Go to http://jsfiddle.net/vem6jg8m/

As you can see it takes a while to load. How would you optimize this code?
How many groups/filters can you load in under 1 sec ?

2. Create twitter advanced search interface using their API.

Resources:
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search
https://twitter.com/search-advanced


A) Estimate how long it will take you to complete the task

B) Build a (simplified) web application to search twitter and push it to github. (spend 4h max. Cut features if you have to) 

C). write a 1-page high level description of your solution. Answer:
	- what you've built
	- which technologies you've used and why
	- how it is tied together
	- your reasons for high-level decisions

If you feel anything is unclear, use your own judgment to make
assumptions (make sure you explain them in C).
