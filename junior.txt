1. Basic CS

Solve exercises A,B,C and explain your reasoning. It's ok to use pseudo code where needed. 
Or any popular language you're comfortable with.

A) Write a SQL query that returns names and emails of customers whose credit cards are about to get expired (in the next 14 days).

Data model looks like this:

Table Customer (id, name, address, email)
Table CustomerCreditCards(id,customer_id, ccnumber, cvs, expirationdate)

B) Write a function SendEmail(to,sub,msg) that sends an email to an email address(to) with subject(sub) and message(msg). 

C) How would you find files that begin with "0aH" and delete them given a folder (with subfolders)?  Assume there are many files in the folder.


2. Explain your thinking process when you get a support tickets below. What would you check first? What questions you'd ask? Etc.

A) Customer can't login. He's tried reset password feature but he's still locked out.

B) Customer credit cards has expired. He's on the settings page. He entered a new credit cards information and clicked the button "Save". Nothing happens.

If you feel anything is unclear, use your own judgement to make assumptions (make sure you explain why that makes sense).
