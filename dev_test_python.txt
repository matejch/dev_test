1. Basic CS

Solve exercises A,B,C,D and explain your reasoning. It's ok to use pseudo code where needed. 
Or any popular language you're comfortable with.

A) Design a SQL database to store NBA players, teams and games. 
Users mostly query game results by date and team name. 
The second most frequent query is players statistics by player name.

B) How would you find files that begin with "0aH" and delete them given a folder (with subfolders)? 
Assume there are many files in the folder.

C) Write a function that sorts 11 small numbers (<100) as fast as possible.
Estimate how long it would take to execute that function 10 Billion (10^10) times on a normal machine?

D) Write a function that sorts 10000 powers (a^b) where a and b are random numbers between 100 and 10000? 
Estimate how long it would take on your machine? 


2. Create a web application that enables users to find NBA players and shows their basic profile and statistics.
Use this api client to get data: https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py

A) Build the web app and push the code to github. (spend 6h max. Cut features if you have to.)
 
B) write a 1 page high level description of your solution. Answer:
	- what you've built
	- which technologies you've used  
	- how it is tied together
	- your reasons for high-level decisions

Write code that solves A and explain your reasoning(B). 
If you feel anything is unclear, use your own judgement to make assumptions (make sure you explain them in B).
