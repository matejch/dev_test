Solve challenges below. If anything is unclear use your own judgment to make a reasonable assumption. Make sure you explain your assumption and reasoning behind it.

1. Basic CS

A) Your friend Oscar has contacted you.  He is opening a DVD library, and wants to computerise his stock and lending records.  He has asked you to design a database for him.

Design an SQL database for Oscar - using these thoughts to help you:

Each member can rent out more than one DVD on each occasion.
The DVD store will typically buy many different copies of the same film, each of which needs to be tracked separately.

B)

You are given a folder of 100k files with the following format:  NAME_SURNAME_TIMESTAMP (names and surnames may repeat several times).
How would you merge the contents of files belonging to each person?


C) You are given a folder with 400k movie subtitles. On average a movie subtitles file contains 10k words.

Write a function that counts how many times a word occurs in a subtitles file.

function count(text, word) -> n

Estimate how long it takes to make a list of (word,count) for all words. 


2. Build a web interface that Oscar will use to manage his DVD rental store.

A) Estimate how long it will take you to complete

B) Build a (simplified) web application that Oscar will use to manage his DVD library and push it to github. (spend 4h max. Cut features if you have to) 

C). write a 1-page high level description of your solution. Answer:
	- what you've built
	- which technologies you've used and why
	- how it is tied together
	- your reasons for high-level decisions

If you feel anything is unclear, use your own judgment to make
assumptions (make sure you explain them in 3).
